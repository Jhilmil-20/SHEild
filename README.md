## What does it do?

This webapp allows users to file their complaints regarding the events and generates anonymous credentials for user.
Users receive these credentials and can use them to follow up on their reported cases. All data is encrypted and stored securely, maintaining anonymity throughout the process.

Additionally, SHEild offers emergency contacts on speed dial, allowing users to quickly reach out for assistance in critical situations. It uses geolocation feature to enables users to send their location to their trusted contact. The application provides a chatbot AI for guidance, offering users a supportive and informative resource to navigate through their experiences and access relevant assistance.
